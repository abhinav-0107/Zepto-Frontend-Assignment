## Specifications
- Click on the input field to display a list of items.
- As you type, the list shows only items that match your input.
- Clicking on an item turns it into a chip at the top, and the input field adjusts automatically.
- Once an item becomes a chip, it is removed from the list.
- Each chip has an "X" icon; clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.

## Bonus Task
- Clean code.
- TypeScript.
- When the input is blank, and the user presses backspace, the last chip (e.g., Nick Giannopoulos) is highlighted. Pressing backspace again deletes the highlighted chip.

## Notes
- This component is built in React (CRA/NextJS).
- The component is designed from scratch without using any component-based library like MUI or Chakra UI.
- CSS solutions, such as Tailwind CSS or SCSS, are utilized for styling.
